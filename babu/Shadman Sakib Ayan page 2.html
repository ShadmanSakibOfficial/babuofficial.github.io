I learned music and harmonium from a song teacher from class 1 to 9. My teacher name was Bablu Chakrabarti. He is<br>
a talented musician in Narail city. In the middle of class 9, I shifted from harmonium to guitar. Before the shift,<br> 
I took full control of the harmonium. I bought my first guitar in 2015. My guitar teacher was a senior brother beside<br> 
my home. I learned basic theory of guitar from him. But after some month, he shifted in Dhaka. Then i started self learning.<br>
